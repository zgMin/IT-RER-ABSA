"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing.","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"

"This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.","[{'term': 'manager', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"

Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
