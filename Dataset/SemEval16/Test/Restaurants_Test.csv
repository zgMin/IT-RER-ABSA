That was the last night in Vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing - so we walked in the check the place.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
"We were seated right away, the table was private and nice.","[{'term': 'table', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
The service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters.,"[{'term': 'service', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'waiters', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
"The food was very good, filet mignon was probably the best I've ever try.","[{'term': 'food', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'filet mignon', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
"The portions are big though, so do not order too much.","[{'term': 'portions', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
Groovy music made the dinner casual.,"[{'term': 'music', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd.,"[{'term': 'restroom', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.","[{'term': 'bathroom', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
There were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"

Insultingly Overpriced,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
- Mediocre Service/Quality,"[{'term': 'Service', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
"– This review is for the Southglen location which is not listed in Citysearch:  I wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but Snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service, so this review as well as the other negative ones for their Larimer location will go unaddressed.","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.,"[{'term': 'Snooze', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'menu', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'Snooze', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $3.","[{'term': 'orange juice', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.","[{'term': 'juice', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their menu was so unique that I continued.,"[{'term': 'menu', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
"The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6"" pancakes (one of them was more like 5"") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced.","[{'term': 'pancakes', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
"The pancakes should be larger (at least 8"") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings.","[{'term': 'pancakes', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
The flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
"On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.","[{'term': 'eggs', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'meal', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.,"[{'term': 'dish', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.,"[{'term': 'manager', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).","[{'term': 'pancakes', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'breakfast burrito', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'orange juice', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'iced tea', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
This was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at Le Peep.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"

"Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.","[{'term': 'Sound views', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"

"My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.","[{'term': 'white gulf prawns', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'manila clams', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'soy dressing', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'butter sauce', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'Shilshole Sampler', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"

The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).,"[{'term': 'scallops', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"

Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
