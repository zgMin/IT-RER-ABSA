"While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.","[{'term': 'bottle of wine', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
"This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.","[{'term': 'frontman', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else.","[{'term': 'maitre-D', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"If you go here, do it on his off-night.","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"

The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.,"[{'term': 'The Four Seasons restaurant', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"

Taking Hot Dogs to the next level,"[{'term': 'Hot Dogs', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
"At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.","[{'term': 'Bark', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'hot dog', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.,"[{'term': 'hot dog', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
Great Atmosphere,"[{'term': 'Atmosphere', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"

Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.,"[{'term': 'Casa la Femme', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"

When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.,"[{'term': 'manager', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"

Canâ€™t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.,"[{'term': 'restaurant', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
What a hassle!,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
"The food is very good, but not outstanding.","[{'term': 'food', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
"There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.","[{'term': 'staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'wait', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
"Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.","[{'term': 'staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"Without the wait or attitude, I would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops.","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
Expensive,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"

"The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.","[{'term': 'pasta', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"

The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.,"[{'term': 'hostess', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.,"[{'term': 'bartender', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.,"[{'term': 'waitress', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party.""","[{'term': 'waitress', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
What?,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.,"[{'term': 'staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'customer service', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"

"I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.","[{'term': 'waitress', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'waiter', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.,"[{'term': 'waiter', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
"The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).","[{'term': 'waitress', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
"She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
